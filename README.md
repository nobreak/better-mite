# better-mite

Idea of this project to make your live easier when you have to us [mite](https://mite.yo.lk/) as time tracking system.

Maybe you also have to book every day the same entries mite. 
Maybe you also could not remeber what you made on monday and so you need to check your emails, your calendar, your chat protocol or git commit messages.
Maybe you also nerved to find your project or service again and again in a list of options where I only need 5 %.

This clients allows me to make my mite bookings easier and faster.

It allwos me to configure my main projects and assign my services to it.
It shows me for every day what I made and allows me to easiely choose this to book it into mite.
(Currently only based on my google calendar - but gmail, github, gitlab, rescueTime interfaces are on the road map.)
It also suggest to me projects and services based on my typed message for the mite entry.

This is still in development. How To will be come when the genreal idea is finalized.
